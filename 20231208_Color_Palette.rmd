## Introduction
This is a notebook to make set the color scheme for working FFAR data

## Set HEX codes
Broadly Michgan region sites are blue, Wyoming yellow and Oklahoma green
Coffee Ranch is dark green, Red River is the brighter green

Within the core sites, blocks are colored light to dark as block # increases

Adaptive sites are denoted with a crosshatch pattern, prescriptive sites have none

```{r set colors}
cols <- cbind(c("CR","MI","RR","WY"),c("#40442D","#3E8AD5", "#7F8954","#D8B712"))
row.names(cols) <- cols[,1]

pals <- list()
pals[['MI']] <-  c("#79BAF2","#3E8AD5", "#205291")
pals[['CR']] <- c("#797D40","#4B4B17","#232400")  
pals[['RR']] <- c("#969E55","#666D27","#353E00")
pals[['WY']] <- c("#F2DDA4","#F0DB6E","#D8B712","#B59655","#705300")
